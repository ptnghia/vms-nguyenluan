## 📊 COMPARISON: Root vs docs/

### **Root README.md:**
```yaml
Purpose: Landing page, quick overview
Length: 300 lines
Focus: Quick start, system specs, features
Audience: New users, quick reference
```

### **docs/README.md:**
```yaml
Purpose: Documentation hub
Length: 273 lines
Focus: Detailed structure, links, next steps
Audience: Developers, detailed information
```

**Relationship:**
- Root README → Quick overview + link to docs/
- docs/README → Detailed documentation hub
- Both aligned on test/dev focus
