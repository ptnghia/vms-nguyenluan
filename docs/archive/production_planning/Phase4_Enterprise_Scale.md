## 📋 **DELIVERABLES**

### **1. Infrastructure Scale-out**
```yaml
Hardware:
  - Complete 6 recording nodes
  - 4 storage nodes (warm tier)
  - 10Gbps network backbone
  - 2N UPS power
  
Deployment:
  - Load balancer (HAProxy/NGINX)
  - Database HA (PostgreSQL streaming replication)
  - Redis Cluster
  - Monitoring stack
```

### **2. High Availability**
```yaml
Features:
  - Node failover automation
  - Health monitoring
  - Auto-recovery
  - Backup/restore procedures
  
Tools:
  - Keepalived for VIP
  - Consul for service discovery
  - Automated failover scripts
```

### **3. Advanced Security**
```yaml
Features:
  - Multi-Factor Authentication (TOTP)
  - Enhanced audit logging
  - Encryption at rest (LUKS)
  - TLS 1.3 everywhere
  - Firewall hardening
  
Compliance:

## 💰 **BUDGET**

```yaml
Hardware (Complete deployment):
  Remaining recording nodes: 3× $5,500 = $16,500
  Storage nodes: 4× $4,000 = $16,000
  Network upgrade: $4,000
  UPS & cooling: $6,000
  Total: $42,500

Cameras:
  Remaining 150 cameras: 150× $300 = $45,000
  (Or use existing infrastructure cameras)

Software:
  Monitoring services: $1,000
  Security tools: $500

Personnel:
  Infrastructure team: 10 weeks @ $5,000/week = $50,000

Total: $139,000
Target: $27,000 (optimize with existing cameras & infra)
```

## 📊 **VALIDATION**

```yaml
Performance Tests:
  ✅ 200 cameras recording 24/7
  ✅ CPU utilization: <50%
  ✅ Network: 800Mbps < 1Gbps
  ✅ Storage: Auto-tiering working
  
HA Tests:
  ✅ Node failure → Auto-failover
  ✅ Database failover: <30s
  ✅ No data loss
  
Security Tests:
  ✅ Penetration testing passed
  ✅ MFA working
  ✅ Audit logs complete
```
