## 📋 **DELIVERABLES**

### **1. Multi-Quality Transcode**
```yaml
Implementation:
  - Update C++ recording engine
  - Dual QSV transcode pipeline
  - Single FFmpeg process per camera
  
Outputs per camera:
  - Recording: 1080p copy (no CPU)
  - Low: 720p @ 2Mbps (QSV)
  - High: 1440p @ 5Mbps (QSV)
  
Resource Impact:
  - CPU per camera: 4.5% → 9.5%
  - Total: 39.6% (still excellent)
```

### **2. Adaptive Client Logic**
```yaml
Frontend:
  - AdaptiveStreamManager class
  - Auto quality selection
  - Smooth switching
  - Manual override option
  
API:
  - /stream?quality=low|high
  - Batch stream URLs
  - Quality metadata
```

### **3. Network Upgrade**
```yaml
Hardware:
  - 10Gbps switch for monitoring center
  - 4× 10Gbps NICs for workstations
  - SFP+ cables/modules
  
Cost: ~$2,000
Benefit: Future-proof for 500+ cameras
```

### **4. Monitoring & Analytics**
```yaml
New Metrics:
  - Quality distribution
  - Bandwidth per quality
  - Switching events
  - User experience scores
  
Dashboard:
  - Real-time quality stats
  - Bandwidth usage graphs
  - Performance insights
```

## 💰 **BUDGET**

```yaml
Network Hardware:
  10Gbps switch: $1,500
  4× 10Gbps NICs: $400
  Cables: $100
  Total: $2,000

Software:
  - All open source: $0

Personnel:
  2 developers × 7 weeks @ $2,500/week = $35,000
  (Can be internal team)

Target Total: $2,000 (hardware only)
```

## 📊 **PERFORMANCE VALIDATION**

### **Resource Tests:**
```yaml
Per Camera:
  Decode (QSV): 0.5%
  Recording (copy): 0%
  Low transcode: 3%
  High transcode: 6%
  Total: 9.5% CPU

200 Cameras:
  CPU: 1900% = 19 cores
  Available: 48 cores
  Utilization: 39.6% ✅
```

### **Bandwidth Tests:**
```yaml
Worst Case (192 cameras @ 1440p):
  Camera → VMS: 768Mbps ✅
  VMS → Clients: 960Mbps ✅
  
10Gbps Network:
  Utilization: 9.6%
  Headroom: 90.4% ✅
```

### **Quality Switching:**
```yaml
Test Scenarios:
  - Grid 64 → Grid 16: <2s
  - Grid 16 → Fullscreen: <1s
  - Fullscreen → Grid 64: <2s
  
User Experience:
  - Smooth transitions ✅
  - No buffering ✅
  - Automatic (no manual selection) ✅
```
