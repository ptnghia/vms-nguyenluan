  - Processing: <200ms per frame
  - Accuracy: >90%
  - Throughput: 50 cameras @ 1fps analysis
```

### **2. Motion Detection**
```yaml
Features:
  - Zone-based detection
  - Sensitivity adjustment
  - Smart filtering (ignore rain, leaves)
  - Event recording
  
Implementation:
  - OpenCV background subtraction
  - Or FFmpeg motion detection
  - Alert rules engine
```

### **3. Vehicle Analytics**
```yaml
Metrics:
  - Vehicle counting
  - Speed estimation
  - Type classification (car, truck, motorcycle)
  - Traffic flow analysis
  
Dashboard:
  - Real-time statistics
  - Historical trends
  - Heatmaps
  - Reports
```

### **4. Real-time Alerts**
```yaml
Channels:
  - WebSocket (web)
  - Push notifications (mobile)
  - Email
  - SMS (Phase 4)
  
Alert Types:
  - LPR match (watchlist)
  - Motion detected
  - Camera offline
  - Storage warning
```
