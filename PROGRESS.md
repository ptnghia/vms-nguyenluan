# Phase 1 MVP Progress Report

**Updated:** October 20, 2025  
**Overall Completion:** 98%  
**Environment:** Test/Development

---

## 📊 **Executive Summary**

Phase 1 MVP is 98% complete with 2 cameras actively recording 24/7. The system is functional and stable, but requires CPU and storage optimization before scaling to 5 cameras.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Recording Engine: 100% complete
- ✅ API Backend: 100% complete
- ✅ Live Streaming: 100% complete
- ⏳ Frontend: 95% complete (playback page in progress)
- 📋 Optimization: 0% (next priority)

---

## ✅ **Completed Components**

### **Week 1-2: Infrastructure & Recording Engine** (100%)

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Ubuntu Server 22.04 setup
- ✅ FFmpeg 6.1.1+ with NVENC support
- ✅ PostgreSQL 15 database
- ✅ Redis 7 cache
- ✅ PM2 process manager
- ✅ Git repository initialized

**Recording Engine (C++):**
- ✅ RTSP capture from IP cameras
- ✅ 24/7 recording @ 1080p H.264
- ✅ MP4 segmentation (3-minute segments)
- ✅ Storage management (2-day retention)
- ✅ Auto-reconnect on failure
- ✅ Health monitoring
- ✅ Multi-camera support (2 cameras online)

**Live Streaming:**
- ✅ MediaMTX RTSP/HLS/WebRTC server
- ✅ Dual-quality transcoding (720p + 1440p)
- ✅ NVIDIA NVENC hardware encoding
- ✅ Low latency (~350ms)

---

### **Week 3: API & Backend Services** (100%)

**API Endpoints:**
- ✅ Camera CRUD operations
- ✅ Recording query and search
- ✅ JWT authentication (6 endpoints)
- ✅ Streaming integration (4 endpoints)

---

### **Week 4: Frontend Development** (95%)

**Completed:**
- ✅ React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- ✅ Login/authentication
- ✅ Dashboard with camera grid
- ✅ Live view with HLS player

**In Progress:**
- ⏳ Recording playback page (95%)

---

## 📋 **Next Priority: Optimization**

### **Current Issues:**

```yaml
CPU Usage:
  Current: 126% per camera (3 FFmpeg processes)
  Issue: Not sustainable for 5 cameras
  
Storage Usage:
  Current: 48.48 GB/day per camera
  Issue: 5 cameras would exceed available space
```

### **Optimization Plan:**

**Phase 1: Single-Process + QSV** (6 hours)
```yaml
Goal: Reduce CPU and storage usage

Expected Results:
  CPU: 126% → 15% per camera (88% reduction)
  Storage: 48.48 GB → 21.6 GB/day (55% reduction)
```
